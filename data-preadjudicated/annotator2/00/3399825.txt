Increased in vitro tetraploidy and mandibular osteomas in patients with and without colorectal diseases.

One hundred and seventy-six individuals with various colorectal diseases were investigated simultaneously for increased in vitro tetraploidy in dermal fibroblast cultures and for occult mandibular osteomas. In only 10 of the 176 persons were both presumed markers of colorectal genetic predisposition present in the same individual. No evidence was found that these traits are causally associated. A combination of the two presumed markers showed a tendency towards occurrence in individuals with a positive family history of colorectal cancer among first-degree relatives.
