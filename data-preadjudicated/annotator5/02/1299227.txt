Colorectal carcinoma. DNA ploidy pattern and prognosis with reference to tumor DNA heterogeneity.

Nuclear DNA content was measured in 72 colorectal carcinomas using single-cell microspectrophotometry on Feulgen-stained smears. Four samples were analyzed from each tumor. Patients were followed for 41-65 months (average, 53). DNA heterogeneity (both aneuploid and nonaneuploid patterns) was present in 44% of the cases. Sixty-eight percent of the tumors showed an aneuploid DNA pattern in at least one of the samples. Patients with nonaneuploid tumors tended to have a survival advantage over patients with homogeneously aneuploid tumors and demonstrated a significantly longer disease-free survival. The DNA ploidy pattern is of potential value in conjunction with histopathologic prognostic parameters in colorectal carcinoma. Since colorectal tumors exhibit pronounced DNA heterogeneity, multiple samples are required from each tumor to permit a proper evaluation of its DNA pattern. The DNA heterogeneity may represent tumor progression and can partly explain the conflicting results reported concerning DNA pattern and prognosis in colorectal carcinoma.
