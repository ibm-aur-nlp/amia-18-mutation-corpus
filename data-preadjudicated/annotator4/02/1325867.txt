Direct chromosome analysis of seven primary colorectal carcinomas.

Chromosome studies were performed on direct preparations of seven cases of primary colorectal carcinomas. Two cases had relatively simple chromosome changes: 48,XY,+8,+21/51, XY,+8,+9,+10,+i(17q),+21, and 47,der(X)t(X;14)(q11;q11)-Y,t(6;18)(p22;q24)+7,+8,der(19)t (19;?)(q13;?). The five others had complicated deletions and translocations; 1p- was noted in five cases, and i(17q) was noted in three cases.
