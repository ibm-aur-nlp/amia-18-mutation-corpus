[Indications for prophylactic hysterectomy].

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in France with an incidence in France in 2010, of 6560 new cases and 1900 deaths secondary to endometrial cancer. The main risk factors are age, hyperoestrogenic factors and hereditary syndroms. Prophylactic hysterectomy could prevent endometrial cancer in case of risk factors such as genetic syndroms. Actually, only Lynch syndrome is a validate indication and should be discussed in patients older than 40-45 years. Prophylactic hysterectomy does not seem a reasonable option to patients carrying BRCA 1 or 2 mutation.
