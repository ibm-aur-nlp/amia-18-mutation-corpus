Loss of heterozygosity of APC and DCC tumor suppressor genes in human sporadic colon cancer.

We examined 36 cases of human sporadic colon carcinoma and corresponding normal tissue samples to evaluate loss of heterozygosity at the APC and DCC tumor suppressor genes loci using restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analysis. Observed informativity was 83% for APC and 75% for DCC. DNA from 6 (20%) of 30 informative tumors exhibited loss of heterozygosity at the APC locus. Loss of heterozygosity at the DCC locus was observed in 7 (26%) of 27 informative tumor DNAs. Our results support the view that malignant progression is a consequence of more than one genetic change and suggest that inactivation of APC and DCC genes plays a role in a multistep process of colon tumor progression.
