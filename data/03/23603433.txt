Instability at the FRA8I common fragile site disrupts the genomic integrity of the KIAA0146, CEBPD and PRKDC genes in colorectal cancer.

Specific patterns of genomic aberrations have been associated with different types of malignancies. In colorectal cancer, losses of chromosome arm 8p and gains of chromosome arm 8q are among the most common chromosomal rearrangements, suggesting that the centromeric portion of chromosome 8 is particularly sensitive to breakage. Genomic alterations frequently occur in the early stages of tumorigenesis at specific genomic regions known as common fragile sites (cFSs). CFSs represent parts of the normal chromosome structure that are prone to breakage under replication stress. In this study, we identified the genomic location of FRA8I, spanning 530 kb at 8q11.21 and assessed the composition of the fragile DNA sequence. FRA8I encompasses KIAA0146, a large protein-coding gene with yet unknown function, as well as CEBPD and part of PRKDC, two genes encoding proteins involved in tumorigenesis in a variety of cancers. We show that FRA8I is unstable in lymphocytes and epithelial cells, displaying similar expression rates. We examined copy number alteration patterns within FRA8I in a panel of 25 colorectal cancer cell lines and surveyed publically available profiles of 56 additional colorectal cancer cell lines. Combining these data shows that focal recombination events disrupt the genomic integrity of KIAA0146 and neighboring cFS genes in 12.3% of colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, data analysis revealed evidence that KIAA0146 is a translocation partner of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in recurrent t(8;14)(q11;q32) translocations in a subset of patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our data molecularly describe a region of enhanced chromosomal instability in the human genome and point to a role of the KIAA0146 gene in tumorigenesis.
