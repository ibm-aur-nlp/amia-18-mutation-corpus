The T393C polymorphism in the gene GNAS1 of G protein is associated with survival of patients with invasive breast carcinoma.

The GNAS1 locus encodes the G(alpha)s protein which stimulates the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Subsequently the cAMP pathway mediates various pleiotropic effects including regulation of apoptosis and proliferation. We have recently shown that genotypes of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T393C in the gene GNAS1 are associated with survival of patients suffering from bladder, renal cell and colorectal carcinoma. In the present study, the genotypes of the T393C SNP were determined in 279 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Comparing the genotypes with the overall survival as well as important clinico-pathological parameters showed that carriers of the T allele had a significantly less favourable course of the disease when compared to carriers of the homozygous CC genotype. In multivariate analysis the homozygous TT genotype was independently associated with a decreased overall survival. Our results suggest that the GNAS1 T393C SNP is a novel genetic host factor for disease progression in patients with invasive breast carcinoma.
