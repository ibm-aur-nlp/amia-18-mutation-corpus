Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis associated with advanced rectal cancer in a 16-year-old boy: report of a case.

We herein present a case of attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) with advanced rectal cancer in a 16-year-old boy. His mother and younger brother both had subcutaneous soft tissue tumors in the back and sparse-type colorectal polyposis. His mother also had dental anomalies and gastric fundic gland polyposis. The patient was admitted to our hospital for investigation of bloody stools. Barium enema and colonofiberscopy revealed advanced rectal cancer and sparse (<50) colorectal polyps. He also had dental anomalies, a subcutaneous soft tissue tumor in the back, and gastric fundic gland polyposis as extracolonic manifestations. A total proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis were performed, and histological examination of the resected specimens confirmed moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas of the rectum with metastases to the regional lymph nodes. The other colorectal polyps were tubular adenomas with no evidence of malignancy. Germline mutations in the APC gene were observed in codons 486, 545, 1493, and 1556. This case serves to demonstrate that a total proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis should be the procedure of choice for young patients found to have advanced rectal cancer associated with FAP.
